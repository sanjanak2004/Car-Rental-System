# Car Rental System  

The Car Rental System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate and manage car rentals efficiently while applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  

## Features  

- **Rent a Car** – Easily rent cars through an interactive console.  
- **Return a Car** – Return previously rented cars and update availability.  
- **Customer Management** – Add new customers and maintain customer records.  
- **Car Management** – Manage cars, brands, models, and pricing details.  
- **Rental History** – Keep track of rentals, customers, and rental durations.  

## Key Concepts Implemented  

- **Encapsulation** – Organized code structure with well-defined classes and methods.  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** – A flexible and scalable car inventory system.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple console-based interaction for renting and returning cars.  
- **Dynamic Pricing Calculation** – Rental prices based on car type and duration.  
- **Efficient Management** – Systematically handles customers, cars, and rental transactions.  

This project serves as an excellent learning resource for Java OOP concepts while demonstrating practical implementation in a real-world scenario.
